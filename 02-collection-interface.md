# Collection Interface

- This is the root interface of the collection framework.
- It is a part of `java.util` package.
- Other collection interfaces such as `List`, `Set` and `Queue` are extended by it.
- Since it is an interface, you can instantiate it.
- It provides a blueprint for the basic operations that are common to all collections.
- The blueprint involves all sorts of basic adding, removing and checking the existence of elements in a collection.
